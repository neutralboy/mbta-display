# ESP-C6-LCD-1.47

This is a starter repository for the ESP-C6-LCD-1.47 development board, which features an ESP32-C6 microcontroller and a 1.47-inch LCD display. This repository provides example code and libraries to help you get started with your development.
I got the product off of [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808021195018.html)

The starter repository I got from Spotpear had a demo repo but I could not get it working at all, I had to modify things so that it works with the latest ESP-IDF version (v5.0 at the time of writing).
